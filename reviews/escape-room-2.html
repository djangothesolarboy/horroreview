                        The sequel to a film I thought I would enjoy, but in the end I was fairly disappointed in how the entire film plays out. The film isn't terrible, but it felt like it fell short on many things it could have exceeded in. <br><br>

                        Maybe the reason it fell flat was because, more than likely, this was just a way for them to make more money while banking in on the craze of escape rooms. Now don't get me wrong, I too enjoy escape rooms, and the thought of that one may be of nefarious intent, is scary. But in the end they could've just left this film out entirely. <br><br>

                        Or even, they could have brought this backstory they so graciously gave us in the second film, in the first instead. Because honestly, I did think the backstory was interesting. But I also know the backstory was merely a way for them to milk the cow some more for a third film.
