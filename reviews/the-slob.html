                        I was looking for a god disturbing horror book to read, as I hadn't read very many. I tend to enjoy gore films and was eager to find a book in a similar vein. <br><br>
                        
                        I don't know how I came across this book, but I am glad that I did. It is very graphic all the way through. Although at times it felt like something was missing or felt a little rushed, I enjoyed reading this. I mean mostly enjoyed given the subject matter. <br><br>
                        
                        Overall if you are looking for gore but in book form, this is definitely up your alley. It is very detailed with a
                        pretty likable main character Vera. I am excited to get my hands on the second book as well!
