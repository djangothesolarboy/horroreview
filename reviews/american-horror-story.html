                        When I originally heard about AHS being shot in my home state(MA), I was pretty excited. Regardless of how the past few seasons have been, I still had some hope this season would be at least decent. <br><br>

                        Red Tide was definitely my favorite out of the split season, and not because of it being in my home state. I personally just felt like this half was a more solid one. The story is pretty good and wasn't super boring or too weird. But I would also say it almost didn't even feel like horror. Yes there were elements of horror but it just didn't feel like the AHS we have been used to. <br><br>

                        Now even with me saying it was my favorite half of the season, doesn't even mean I really liked it. It was honestly just <i>okay</i>. It was nothing fantastic, and it certainly didn't give us a good return either. <br><br>

                        Overall, it was just meh. In reality, just another shot at an already dead horse.

                        Oh Death Valley, a strange strange half of the season. One I did not really care for, other than the fact I feel like we got a bit more of Sarah Paulson. It really was just, there. I didn't really enjoy any of it. The story was just sort of mashed together I felt, and just not all that interesting. It also didn't feel very horror either. It felt far more scifi than horror, and even that wasn't to my liking. <br><br>

                        Even as much as I have loved AHS in the past, I still wish it would just end. They keep putting out these mediocre seasons in the hopes to get fans excited. When in the end, all that happens is we are disappointed.
