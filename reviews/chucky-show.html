                    Season 1 - Episode 1 <button class='display-button' onclick='display()'>￫</button>
                    <p class="display-episode-review" style='display: none;'>Many fans are going to wonder how Chucky could be made into a TV show. If you've seen any Childs Play film, you will know that Chucky isn't exactly safe for work. Between his jokes and some of the gore the films have shown, making a show out of it seems like it is toning down Chucky himself. <br><br>
                    The show centers around a young teen named Jake, who likes to use secondhand dolls in art projects. And thus, this is why he purchases the Chucky doll from a yard sale, to add to his art project. Only instead of being able to add Chucky to the piece, Chucky begins to roll out a new plan. <br><br>
                    The first episode of the show definitely packs a lot in it at once. You would have thought that they might take more time to build up the story before anyone becomes prey to the murderous doll. But instead, we already have begun the kill counter on episode 1. <br><br>
                    Overall, I am pretty excited for the show to progress. We are given a gay teen as our main protagonist, which yes we have had <i>some</i> but honestly not enough. I am sure that some gay teens who like horror will appreciate this especially. The show will definitely have to play its cards right in order to win the praise of horror fans, since there haven't been many shows based on such an iconic horror icon. At least, not in a very long time. <br><br>
                    For now, I will just say I am excited and hopeful for the series to not only do well, but be something I enjoy watching. Only time will tell!
