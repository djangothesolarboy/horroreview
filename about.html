                <p class="about-text">Dandelion has always had a passion for creating things, whether it was writing, or drawing,theyhas always tried to find
                ways to express himself creatively. Programming is no different. <br><br>
                
                As a child they always had curiousities about the inner workings of electronics and computers. What was once a curiousity,
                eventually became a passion. Programming has been seen as a new means of creativity for him, but also pulling together
                some of his other passions as well. He intends to work on game development as side projects.</p><br><br>
